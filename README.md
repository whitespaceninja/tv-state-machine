# tv-state-machine
Console app showing how to implement a simple state machine

This is a .net command line solution showing a simple setup for a state machine. It happens to use a TV to illustrate it.

Running the project(s) and pressing spacebar will toggle the 'tv' on and off. The advanced project mimics an old fashioned tv while the other one is much simpler and only goes on/off
